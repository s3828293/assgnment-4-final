				&emsp;&emsp;Well, the above is the finished product of my assignment 1. Although the score is not high, it is already the highest score among my three assignments. But actually I am still very satisfied with it. When I first chose New City among many video clips, I used it all the way to the end. I think the animation interface is easier to edit logically, and that's why I chose it. I didn't meet much resistance when programming the new story. I thought of several and the theme of the final product was that people got tired of the crowded city and chose to escape to the universe. The story was simple, but I don't think I did a very good job of mastering the first edit. I didn't even add transitions two days before finishing the final product, when I didn't know how to add them, and luckily my classmate Charlene saved me. In fact, editing alone is not particularly difficult, the most difficult part of this assignment for me is the choice of background music and sound effects, my story needs a lot of sound, I also want to express the atmosphere of the story through various background music, and finally did find the sound that matches it, but before submitting the finished product, Cy told me that my sound and picture details are not in sync, so I revised it in time, thanks a lot Cy.hahaha. I think what I'm still missing in Assignment 1 is probably some more imaginative ideas and some attention to detail, which are very important and I will definitely pay attention to them in the future.

				&emsp;&emsp;Alright, next is my assignment 2, for this assignment, at first we chose one of the twelve concepts as our theme, and we actually listed some things for each concept, which facilitated me to choose the final concept later. Yes, I ended up choosing the concept of home because many of the things in my home are things that I come into contact with on a daily basis, and one is always so comfortable with what one knows. However, in the process of completing this assignment I encountered difficulties that were unprecedented at that time, first of all, I did not understand the artistic concept of color and shape thoroughly, and even the final finished icon was extremely rough compared to others, although this was not the focus of this time, but at that time it was also extremely distressing to me. Then I came across something I had never touched before, and that was html code writing. In fact, I was a bit devastated when I first found out I had to learn this, and I was actually quite afraid of this type of thing, so I avoided it for a while, but then I thought about it, and sooner or later I had to face it, and this is what I was learning and what I wanted, so I still even finished it. The last one I encountered again in the github upload link, which is strange, I consulted many professionals did not get an answer, and did not succeed in uploading it to github, I even face-to-face operation with a classmate who studied computer science for two years did not upload it successfully, I hope everything goes well with this html file upload.

				&emsp;&emsp;Assignment 3 had to do with 3d animation and unity game design, and I completely blew it. This is probably the worst assignment I've ever done. I was very distracted during the first and second week of this assignment, and as with the previous html project, I chickened out again and didn't want to face it at all. However, by the time I actually remembered to finish it, it was too late. All this is an afterthought, so let me get back to the assignment itself. My idea is to create a four major environments covering the evolution of the Earth, starting with the primitive oceanic period, followed by the primitive forest, then gradually the emergence of the primary human civilization, and finally the modern human civilization. Perhaps this idea was quite creative at first glance, but I deviated from the original intent of the topic and did not change it until the end, all because of my lack of seriousness about this assignment. Then came the 3d environment design, in this area I also did not put much effort, I made a land, very simple one, all the other assets are in the asset store to find something rough, in fact, asset rough is not important, a house is rough again, it is also possible to arrange some other decorations, but I did not This is the worst assignment I've done so far, and I don't want to say much about it. This semester I did not take it seriously, next semester must bring a different attitude. Cheers.
